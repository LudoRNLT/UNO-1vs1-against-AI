# UNO-1vs1-against-AI
Uno project implemented in Python, for the subject "Programming Methodology" in the first year of my Bachelor's degree (L1).

The game features cards ranging from 0 to 9, with 4 colors: RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW. And special cards:

A skip card
A reverse card
A +2 card
A +4 card
A redistribution card

The goal of the game is to recreate a game of Uno against an opponent in the form of an AI, with the game and its rules being revisited. To play the game and test it, simply download the "Uno_Rendu.py" code from this GitLab repository and run it in a Python-compatible environment. Once launched, the game can be played automatically.
